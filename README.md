# Sum Time Web Extension

A Chrome extension to sum different units of time together.

This is a personal project to remaster something I made for a workflow friction I used to have.
I had to log work time in a ticket system that could only take one unit of time, requiring conversions like 1 hour 30 minutes to "1.5 hrs".
This would get complex with real numbers, so I iterated on software solutions to have easy number entry and copying results to the clipboard.
I've not had a need for this utility for years, but I wanted to make on final version to satisfy myself.

-   Opens in Chrome's side panel. Convenient access while working across tabs!
-   Results take one click to copy to clipboard!
-   Can take an optional number to divide sums by, which displays with normal sums in results.
-   Customize the number of decimal places sums are rounded to, and the time unit suffixes used in results.
-   Light & dark themes!
